## üî¢ Two Sum Pattern
The **Two Sum** pattern involves identifying pairs of numbers that meet a given condition. It serves as the foundation for many other problems involving sums and subsets.

1. **[Two Sum II - Input Array is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)** - Solved using **two-pointer technique** to find the pair efficiently.
2. **[3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)** - Extends the two-pointer approach to handle triplets while avoiding duplicates.
3. **[4Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/)** - Similar to 3Sum but extends to quadruplets using sorting and two-pointer logic.
4. **[Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subsequences-that-satisfy-the-given-sum-condition/)** - Uses **sorting & binary search** to efficiently count valid subsequences.
5. **[Two Sum IV - Input is a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-iv-input-is-a-bst/)** - Uses **BST traversal + HashSet** to check for complements.
6. **[Sum of Square Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/)** - Uses **mathematical approach & two-pointer technique** to check if a number is a sum of squares.
7. **[Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/)** - Uses **greedy two-pointer approach** to minimize boats required.
8. **[Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/)** - Uses **sorting + two-pointer** to minimize the maximum sum.
9. **[3Sum With Multiplicity](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-with-multiplicity/)** - Modifies 3Sum to count valid triplets with duplicate values.

## üíß Trapping Rain Water
Water trapping problems require calculating left and right boundaries to determine trapped water.

1. **[Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)** - Uses **prefix max, suffix max, and two-pointer approach** to efficiently calculate trapped water.
2. **[Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)** - Uses **two-pointer approach** to maximize water contained between two heights.

## üîÑ Next Permutation
These problems revolve around **rearranging numbers in lexicographical order**.

1. **[Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)** - Uses **rightmost inversion point + swap + reverse** to find the next lexicographical order.
2. **[Next Greater Element III](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-iii/)** - Similar approach but applied to a single integer.
3. **[Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Reach the Kth Smallest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-to-reach-the-kth-smallest-number/)** - Uses **next permutation logic + swap counting** to determine steps needed.

## üîÅ Reversing & Swapping
These problems involve **in-place modifications** of arrays or strings.

1. **[Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)** - Uses **two-pointer technique** to check for palindromes.
2. **[Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)** - Uses **two-pointer approach** for in-place reversal.
3. **[Reverse Vowels of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/)** - Uses **two pointers to swap vowels only**.
4. **[Valid Palindrome II](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/)** - Modifies palindrome check to allow one removal.
5. **[Reverse Only Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-only-letters/)** - Uses **two-pointer approach** to reverse only letters.
6. **[Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)** - Uses **two-pointer approach** to remove specific elements.
7. **[Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)** - Implements **Dutch National Flag Algorithm** for in-place sorting.
8. **[Flipping an Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/)** - Uses **row-wise reversal & bit flipping**.
9. **[Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)** - Uses **two-pointer approach** to merge squares of negative & positive values.
10. **[Sort Array by Parity](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/)** - Uses **in-place swapping** to separate even and odd numbers.
